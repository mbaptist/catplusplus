CAT++ - CAT Array Templates 
Copyright 2005 Manuel Baptista


In short, CAT++ is a C++ fully templated library for arrays. The main purpose is to provide support for arrays with a similar interface to that of Fortran90, respecting the copy semantics of C++ but avoiding unnecessary copy of data.

Please see INSTALL for instalation instructions. The CAT++ manual is available under the directory doc.
